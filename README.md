# Robotics Operating System (ROS) Templates
This repository contains templates and tools which I find helpful when developing robots using the Robotics Operating System (ROS). I will fill up this repository with additional material as I work on my own ROS projects. 

## Content in this Repository
Note: Items in *italics* are still in progress and will be added to this repository soon!

The main tools contained within this repository are:
1. *A cheatsheet I compiled to list all the main elements of ROS and the relevant terminal commands.*
1. *Instructions of how to install and setup the ROS environment (Melodic Morenia on the Raspberry Pi).*

The generic code templates in this repository are:
1. *A general "Node" template (C++)*
1. *A "Topic" template (C++)*
1. *A "Service" template (C++)*
1. *A "Action" template (C++)*
